# 🏨 Hotel Inventory Forecasting & Recommendation System

This end-to-end project solves a real-world problem faced by a hotel chain that operates bars in multiple locations. The goal is to forecast weekly item-level consumption and recommend optimal inventory levels (par levels) to reduce stockouts and overstocking.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The hotel is facing:
- Stockouts of popular items (causing unhappy customers)
- Overstocking of low-demand items (causing increased costs)

A forecasting and inventory recommendation system is needed to help bar managers make smarter, data-driven stocking decisions.
